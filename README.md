# Memory Card

Memory Card project from The Odin Project curriculum. This is one of my first times using React and its hooks: useState and useEffect

Live Demo: https://memory-card-top.vercel.app/

## Description

This is a memory game where the user has to click a new card everytime (until it resets) to increase their score

### Future additions

- Add a UI that shows if a user clicked a new card or if they clicked it already
- Add a way for the user to choose a brand new set of cards
- Add a way for the user to choose how many cards they can play with

## Tech Stack

- Vite
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Vercel
